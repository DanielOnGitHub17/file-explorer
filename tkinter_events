I apologize for the confusion. Here is a list of **all** the events in Python's tkinter module:

- `<Activate>`: The widget is being activated.
- `<Button-1>`: Button 1 is the leftmost button, button 2 is the middle button (where available), and button 3 the rightmost button.
- `<Button-1>`, `<ButtonPress-1>`, and `<1>` are all synonyms.
- `<B1-Motion>`: The mouse is moved, with mouse button 1 being held down (use B2 for the middle button, B3 for the right button).
- `<Button-2>`: Button 2 is the middle button, or wheel button.
- `<Button-3>`: Button 3 is the rightmost button, or wheel button.
- `<ButtonRelease-1>`: Button 1 was released. This is probably a better choice in most cases than the Button event, because if the user accidentally presses the button, they can move the mouse off the widget to avoid setting off the event.
- `<ButtonRelease-2>`: Button 2 was released.
- `<ButtonRelease-3>`: Button 3 was released.
- `<Colormap>`: The colormap for this widget has changed.
- `<Configure>`: The widget changed size (or location, on some platforms). The new size is provided in the width and height attributes of the event object passed to the callback.
- `<Deactivate>`: The widget is being deactivated.
- `<Destroy>`: The widget is being destroyed.
- `<Enter>`: The mouse pointer entered the widget (this event doesn't mean that the user pressed the Enter key!).
- `<Expose>`: Part of the widget has become visible and needs to be redrawn.
- `<FocusIn>`: Keyboard focus was moved to this widget, or to a child of this widget.
- `<FocusOut>`: Keyboard focus was moved from this widget to another widget.
- `<Gravity>`: The window manager has changed the position of this widget.
- `<Key>`: The user pressed any key. The key is provided in the char member of the event object passed to the callback (this is an empty string for special keys). Most printable characters can be used as is. The exceptions are space (`<space>`) and less than (`<less>`).
- `<KeyPress-A>`, ..., `<KeyPress-Z>`, `<KeyPress-a>`, ..., `<KeyPress-z>`, `<KeyPress-F1>`, ..., `<KeyPress-F12>`, etc.: These events are generated whenever a key is pressed. The detail part of the event object contains a string representing a printable character. Special keys such as function keys or arrow keys are represented by strings such as `'<Up>'` and `'<F1>'`.
- `<KeyRelease-A>`, ..., `<KeyRelease-Z>`, etc.: These events are generated whenever a key is released. They have no detail information.
- `<Leave>`: The mouse pointer left the widget.
- `<Map>`: The widget has been made visible and needs to be redrawn.
- `<Motion>`: The mouse pointer moved over this widget (or a child of this widget) with no buttons pressed down. Use B1-Motion, B2-Motion, and B3-Motion events instead of Motion if you need to distinguish between different buttons.
- `<MouseWheel>`: On Windows and Linux, this event occurs when you rotate your mouse wheel. On macOS, this event occurs when you scroll with two fingers on your trackpad. You can use delta attribute of event object to determine whether scrolling up or down. 
    - For example, `event.delta` will return `-120` when scrolling down and `120` when scrolling up ¹.
    - Note that this event does not work on all platforms ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Shift` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Ctrl` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Alt` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Meta` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Super` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Hyper` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `AltGr` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `CapsLock` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `NumLock` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `ScrollLock` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered by pressing `Insert` while scrolling ¹.
    - This event can also be triggered
